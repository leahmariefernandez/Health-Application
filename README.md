# My Personal Project

The application will  allow patients to add or remove 
their current symptoms to a list of their own medical symptoms.
Of that list, it will prompt the patient to book a COVID-19
test or book an appointment with their doctor. This application
can be used by patients and medical professionals.

I currently work at a vaccination clinic and use the Provincial
Health Services Authority Application (ImmsBC) to book patients
vaccination appointments, as well as, check them in once they
arrive. I've always been interested in healthcare systems and how 
they can be built to make information passed between patients 
and medical professionals efficient.
